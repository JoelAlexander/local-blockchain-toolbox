Setting up a node.

1. Run install.sh to install all dependencies.
2. Setup headscale, either joining a tailnet or hosting one.
3. Import or create a blockchain
4. Host the blockchain on a public domain, gossiping privately on the tailnet.
5. Install applications (contracts + web sites) on the blockchain and make them available from the node.
